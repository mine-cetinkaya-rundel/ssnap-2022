# Reproducibility: who cares?

## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author {.smaller}

-   In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months earlier.

-   Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made available for independent reproduction of results.

    -   Survey incentives misrepresented.
    -   Sponsorship statement false.

-   Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly discovered that the data must have been faked.

-   Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it easier to discover issues.

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

-   **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with current depression and with future depression \[...\].

-   **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with current depression \[...\].

## Divorce study felled by a coding error gets a second chance

-   **Original conclusion:** The risk of divorce in a heterosexual marriage increases when the wife falls ill, but not the husband.

-   **Corrected conclusion:** Based on the corrected analysis, we conclude that there are not gender differences in the relationship between gender, pooled illness onset, and divorce.

## Divorce study retraction: Editor's note {.smaller}

-   "The research environment is fast-paced given the ethos to"publish or perish"."

-   "\[...\] research is becoming increasingly complex, with greater calls for transdisciplinary collaborations,"big data," and more sophisticated research questions and methods \[...\] data sets often have multiple files that require merging, change the wording of questions over time, provide incomplete codebooks, and have unclear and sometimes duplicative variables."

-   "Given these issues, I would not be surprised if coding errors were fairly common \[...\]"

# Reproducibility: why should you care?

## Think back to every time...

> -   The results in Table 1 don't seem to correspond to those in Figure 2.
> -   In what order do I run these scripts?
> -   Where did we get this data file?
> -   Why did I omit those samples?
> -   How did I make that figure?
> -   "Your script is now giving an error."
> -   "The attached is similar to the code we used."

# Reproducibility: how?

## Reproducibility checklist

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns

We need an environment where

-   data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, inseparable

-   reproducibility is built in

    -   the original data remains untouched
    -   all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

-   documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## Toolkit

![](img/toolkit.png){fig-align="center"}

## Outline

1.  Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

2.  Literate programming $\rightarrow$ Quarto

3.  Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# 1. Scriptability

## Point-and-click vs. scripting

-   Learning curve: Point-and-click software (supposedly) have shallower learning curves than scripting languages

-   Documentation: At a minimum, your code documents your analysis

    -   And you can do better with comments and README files

-   Automation: Need to rerun your analysis with new/updated data?
    Just change the input file.

-   Collaboration: Sharing your analysis is as easy as sharing your scripts

## Why R?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Programming language for data analysis
-   Free!
-   Open source
-   Widely used and supported across all disciplines
-   Can be used on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux
-   Thousands of statistical data analysis packages

## Why not language X?

-   There are a number of other great programming tools out there that can also be used to improve the reproducibility of your analysis

-   The key is to use some type of language that will allow you to automate and document your analysis

-   Once you master one language you'll probably find it easier to learn another

## Once in R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You could just type into the command prompt, but that doesn't help much with

-   documentation

or

-   automation

# 2. Literate programming

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)" {.smaller}

> "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we want a computer to do."
>
> "The practitioner of literate programming \[...\] strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other."

-   These ideas have been around for years!
-   and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
-   but they have never been as accessible as the current tools

## A better solution than just R

With RStudio you can combine your programming and your documentation

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Gives you a single environment to combine your documentation and your analysis
-   Runs on top of R

## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

-   Ease of Markdown syntax

-   Rendering of R/Python/Julia/Observable code to produce output and plots

-   Ability to include LaTeX: $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x$

## Sample Quarto document

## Example: Big Five Personality Test

The Big Five personality traits is a theory of five broad dimensions used by some psychologists to describe the human personality and psyche: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

<br>

Load data with an **R chunk**:

```{r}
big5 <- read_delim("raw-data/big5.txt", delim = "\t")
```

## Clean data

You can include script files in your R Markdown document

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("code/01-data-cleanup.R")
```

<img src="img/script.png" alt="script" style="width:600px"/>

## View distribution of age

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3

ggplot(big5, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
summary(big5$age)
```

## Extraversion vs. neuroticism + gender

**Extraversion:** Seeking fulfillment from sources outside the self or in community.
High scorers are social, low scorers prefer to work alone.

**Neuroticism:** Being emotional.

```{r message=FALSE}
m_ext_age <- lm(extraversion ~ neuroticism * gender, data = big5)
tidy(m_ext_age)
```

## Grab coefficients

```{r}
tidy_m <- tidy(m_ext_age)
```

Slope for neuroticism is `r round(tidy_m$estimate[2], 3)`.

## Plot extraversion vs. age and gender {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = big5, aes(x = neuroticism, y = extraversion, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Suppose you want only teens

```{r}
big5_teen <- filter(big5, age <= 19)
```

```{r}
m_ext_age_teen <- lm(extraversion ~ age * gender, data = big5_teen)
tidy(m_ext_age_teen)
```

## Plot for only teens {.smaller}

```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = big5_teen, aes(x = neuroticism, y = extraversion, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# 3. Version control

## What is version control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Every time you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date.

## Best - Version Control

## How does version control work? {.smaller}

-   Start with a base version of the document, save just the changes you made at each step of the way.

-   Think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

![](img/play-changes.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   "Playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.
